      <h1>Emergency First Responder</h1>
      <p>
  Learning how to rescue people goes hand in hand with basic first aid; one of the requirements to become a rescue diver is having a valid first aid certificate with in the last 24months.  As many people do not posses this, at Fifty Six we teach you and Emergency First Responder (EFR) course that covers all the necessary skills to be an effective first responder in the event of an emergency situation occurring.

The EFR course is broken down in to two main sections, Primary Care and Secondary Care.  To prepare you for both sections there is self study from the EFR manual followed by an informative video.  Once both of those have been completed its on to the practical sessions with your instructor.

</ul><p>
During the Secondary care section we now focus on less life-threating situations, this can be described as basic first aid for dealing illness and injuries.  Skills learnt in this part include.
